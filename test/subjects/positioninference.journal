2019/02/14 AAPL (100)         # starting position = 100
  $ 73

2019/05/14 AAPL (+ 20)        # puchased 20 additional shares, position = 120

# now, the following transaction would typically infer position to 120, however,
# we can fix that by attaching an ex-date to the dividend component

2019/05/16 AAPL               # position = 100
  $ 77 @ $ 0.77 [2019/05/10]

# by doing this, the above transaction correctly infers a position = 100,
# but forecasted transactions will have a position = 120, as expected

# we can verify this by putting in a preliminary record

2019/08/15 AAPL               # position = 120
