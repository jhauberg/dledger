2020/01/19 ABC (0)    # closing position before ex-date

# 2020/01/20 ABC      # actual ex-date; sold off to skip this distribution
#   $ 0

2020/02/01 ABC (10)   # opening position after ex-date (see note below)

# note that ideally the opening date would be 2020/01/21 (a day later than ex-date),
# however, due to the grace period on forecasts, we have to date it a bit later
# (the forecast will expect a dividend in the span between 2020/01/15 to 2020/01/31,
#  so the only way to avoid that forecast is to avoid having an open position
#  in that timespan; thus the later date)
